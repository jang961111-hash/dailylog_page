# Daily Log Landing Page

Public landing site for Daily Log.

This project is not the main product experience. It exists to introduce the service, build trust, guide Android installs, and provide support, privacy, and terms pages for public distribution.

## Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- react-qr-code

## Pages

- `/` : product landing page
- `/download` : Android download hub with device-aware CTA priority
- `/roadmap` : product value and roadmap overview
- `/support` : install help, account support, and contact guide
- `/privacy` : privacy policy draft
- `/terms` : terms of service draft

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in the browser.

## APK Delivery

- The landing site is deployed on Vercel.
- Download buttons point to `/download/apk`, which serves the newest `DailyLog*.apk` file found in `release-assets/apk`.
- If no local APK is available, `/download/apk` falls back to the latest GitHub Release APK and then to the last known asset URL.
- Local APK files such as `DailyLog.apk` or `DailyLog_1.0.2.apk` are release source files only and must not be committed to the repository.
- When the APK changes locally, place the new `DailyLog*.apk` file in `release-assets/apk`. GitHub Releases remain the fallback delivery path.
- Vercel deployments should exclude `release-assets/` so production deploys stay lightweight and rely on the GitHub fallback when no local APK is bundled.

## Production Notes

- iOS remains `coming soon` until a real TestFlight or App Store link is available.
- Privacy policy and terms pages are still draft content and should be replaced before public launch.
- Play Store should become the primary Android distribution channel once the app is ready for official release.
